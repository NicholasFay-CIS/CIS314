7-1 A-B


A) 
i x j
16 x 16 = 256 * 4 (the a,r,g,b struct values)
= 1,024 total writes
1,024 / 8 (long size) = 128 misses
1,024 - 128 = 896 hits 
it misses 12.5% of the time
	
B) 
In this algorithm we are grabbing the columns rather than rows (in part A)
Therefore we want to look at each column in the block but the cache is being made up of a linear block of data from the rows. Essentially we will have to load a new block into the cache 25% of the time. This means that the hit rate would be 75%. Thus this means that it misses twice as much as the original function. It misses 256 times and hits 768 times.
